## Visual Theramin

This is my project for Coding 2 for the MSC in creative computing.

My project is called the "Visual Theremin". It allows the user to draw on the screen while also controlling two oscillators both playing a D minor pentatonic scale. 

The first oscillator is controlled by moving the mouse on the X axis, and when the right mouse button is clicked a second oscillator is added and controlled on the Y axis. 

Lines are drawn on the screen by holding down the mouse. The colour changes over time determined by how long the mouse has been pressed. The lines are saved on the screen allowing the user to draw and the resulting image can be saved to the desktop using the "Screenshot" button. 

This was made using C++ in Open Frameworks using the [Maximillian Add-On](https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian).
